Eamon             Hi, you must be our new English flatmate, Ella.

Ella                  Hello. Yes, I '**am**. And you are .?

Eamon             Eamon. Welcome to Florence!

Ella                  Eamon - that's an Irish name.

Eamon             It **is** indeed. I'm from Ballylifin in County Donegal!

Ella                  I know that village . . .

Eamon            Really?! Not many people **do.

Ella                  My dad and my brother played golf there just a couple of years ago.

Eamon             They **didn’t, did** they?! That's amazing!

Ella                  Yeah. So, what about Florence? Have you been living here long?

Eamon            I **have** . I came for a year and I'm still here three years later.

Ella                  You must like it then.

Eamon            I **do**. I can't imagine who **wouldn’t**. And you, you arrived yesterday?

Ella                  Well, I **did**, but my suitcases **didn’t**! They haven't arrived yet.

Eamon            Oh no. Are you going to contact the airline?

Ella                  I already **have**. At first they said they'd be delivered today, but they just called to say they **won’t** be in till tomorrow morning.

Eamon            Oh, that's too bad. If I can help in any way, I **will**. Just ask.

Ella                  Thank you. That's really kind. Are you studying here at the university?

Eamon            I **was**. I studied Italian for a year but now I'm teaching English.

Ella                  You mean Irish!

Eamon            Come on! My accent isn't that strong

Ella                  I can't speak much Italian - I wish I **could**. I'm here to work for an English company but I'm hoping to pick up the language if I **can**.

Eamon            I'm sure you **will** in no time. And I could give you lessons if you like.

Ella                  **Would** you? That'd be fantastic.

Eamon            No problem, I'd really like to. And I'll introduce you to the other two flatmates. They're from the US and Australia. We're quite a mixed bunch!
